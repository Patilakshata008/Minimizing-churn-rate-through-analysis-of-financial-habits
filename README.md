# Minimizing-churn-rate-through-analysis-of-financial-habits
1.Reducing the churn rate using - Logistic Regression (churn  - Active = No | Suspended < 30 = No Else Churn = Yes)
2.Cleaning the data and visulaization of data - pie chart, histogram 
3.Bulding the model - OneHotEncoding , Splitting the data , Scaling of Data.
4.Evaluting the model -F1score ,Confusion Matrix , accuracy score, precission score
5.Improving the model -Recursive feature selection
6.Conclusion : the case study shows which users are likely to churn , and we have considered who are likely to churn , so that we can devevlop new features/products for the people   who are more likely to churn inorder to engage them more in the app.Inorder to future improve the model we can add time decision to churn .
